-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It helps keep track of mistakes during writing code

-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in git vs having versions automatically saved, like google docs does ?

Pros gives you control of saving whenever you think is necessary

Cons one might forget to commit and save changes 

-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google docs, treat each file separately?

Because some codes involve the connection of files and need to be updated but google docs is used more for different files.

-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all the commits of the files and git diff shows where they have been changes

 
-How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now I can be more confident when making changes because I can return to an older version of the file to get it fixed

-Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Save my files in repositories
